Life is a journey
You are never dealt the hand you desire.
You will come up against obstacles that are tough
Questions that cannot be answered or
A Relationships you will have problems in
Your heart will beat, you will sweat
You will cry your eyes out , and
You will quit…, and try again
Everything obstacle you see in life is achievable
you must overcome the obstacles that are in you.
To overcome yourself is the key to
Happiness.
Remember, Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate,
our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond all measure.
